* When running produkey.exe, Some Antivirus programs displays an alert
  and/or block you from running it. Click here to read more about false
  alerts in Antivirus programs
* For some Windows 7/8/2008 licenses, the product key is not stored in
  the Registry, and thus ProduKey cannot retrieve them. In these cases,
  ProduKey will display 'Product key was not found' in the product key
  column.
* If you bought your computer with installed operating system, you may
  find the Windows product key appeared in ProduKey utility is different
  from the product key on your Windows CD. This problem is mostly
  reported with Dell computers.

   ProduKey utility.
